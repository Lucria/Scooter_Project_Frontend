# Beam Software Engineering Intern Exercise Frontend 

This is a system that is capable of fetching a set number of 
scooters specified by a user for a given latitude, longitude within 
a certain distance, and plot it onto a map. 

The goal of building this system is for Beam's Software Engineering Internship
Exercise. 

This repository will house the frontend for this system. The frontend is built using 
VueJS.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Yarn
  
  Yarn is used as the package manger for this frontend project. You may type
  `yarn --version` to verify that yarn is installed and the current version is 1.16.0 and above. 
  Follow the instructions [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) to download Yarn.

## Installing
* Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.  

Using HTTPS:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lucria/beam_intern_test_frontend.git
```

Using SSH:

```
git clone git@github.com:Lucria/beam_intern_test_frontend.git
```

## Restoring Node Packages
Run `yarn` to restore all dependencies and modules.

## Full Instructions On How To Run
1) Navigate to the root directory of this project
2) Run `yarn` first to ensure that all dependencies and modules are downloaded and installed.
All modules are not committed to ensure a slimmer and smaller repository.
3) Start the Frontend web page by running `yarn dev` from the root directory of this project.
